<p>I was lucky enough to have an article published in Linux Insider today on the future of Java.  I do have to say that writing an article for a publication is not as easy as writing a blog post.  I would love to tell you what it is all about, but I would rather you go and check it out for yourself!</p><p><a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/71532.html">http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/71532.html</a></p>
