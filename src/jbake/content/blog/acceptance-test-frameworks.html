<p>I was recently asked my opinions and views on three acceptance testing frameworks for Java projects.  Rather than respond via email, I figured that my answer could make a great blog post.</p><p>The goal of my assessment is help somebody choose a test automation tool that works well with a Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)/Specification by Example (SBE) approach.  ATDD/SBE both require significant cultural and processes changes.  This is truly the hard part.  This won't be covered in my blog post, but might make a good post.  I recommend reaching Gojko Adzig's Specification by Example for more on the process/cultural side.</p><p>For this assessment, I wanted to cover three tools in particular.  My goal was to provide my perspective on each of them, and not a recommendation.  I do think that all three of these tools are great and you</p><ul><li>Cucumber (JVM)</li><li>FitNesse</li><li>Concordion</li></ul><h2>Assessment Criteria</h2><p>Prior to discussing each of the tools, I wanted to cover my view on what makes a good acceptance test automation tool.</p><ul><li><strong>Specification Layer</strong> - This is the layer where the human readable specs are authored<ul><li><strong>Separation from code</strong> - Does the platform separate the specification from the fixture code?  I find tools like Spock compelling, but don't separate and the code from spec, making it a developer friendly tool</li><li><strong>Language</strong> - What language(s) does one have to learn to author specifications?</li><li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - How does the team access the specs for authoring or updates?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Configuration Management</strong> - How well does the tool integrate with or support version control?</li><li>Fixture Layer -<ul><li>Specification Integration -</li><li>Language support -</li><li></li></ul></li><li>Modularity -</li><li>Publishing -</li><li>Community -</li></ul><p>Disclaimer: I also wanted to add that I have deployed Concordion and Cucumber in production, but I have yet to implement FitNesse.  This may color my views so please, take my recommendations with a grain of salt.</p><p>Cucumber</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FitNesse</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Concordion</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion</p>
