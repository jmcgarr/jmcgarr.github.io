<p>I was recently interviewed for the SD Times for an article on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a>.    The focus of the article is on using Continuous Integration on non-Agile projects.  It is a very good article and my name is mentioned on page 33.  I hope that you enjoy!</p><p><a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/content/SDTimesPDFEdition.aspx?File=sdtimes256.pdf">http://www.sdtimes.com/content/SDTimesPDFEdition.aspx?File=sdtimes256.pdf</a></p>
