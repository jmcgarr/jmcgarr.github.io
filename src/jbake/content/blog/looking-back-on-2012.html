title=Looking back on 2012date=2013-02-04type=posttags=continuous delivery, Excella Consultingstatus=published~~~~~~<p>2012 has been an exciting year, full of change and merriment. Here's my retrospective.</p><h3>Excella Consulting<img align="right" alt="excella" src="/img/excella.png" width="150" height="150" /></h3><p>The majority of 2012 I spent working at Excella Consulting, a great local IT and Agile consulting firm. While there, I worked on advancing their Java Center of Excellence. &nbsp;I enjoyed my stay there and learned a lot from everybody. &nbsp;I worked with some great clients and had a blast. &nbsp;Excella is a bunch of smart individuals and I highly recommend hiring them or working for them. &nbsp;They are a great place to work.</p><h3><img align="left" alt="speaking" src="/img/speaking.jpg" width="300" height="179" />Public Speaking</h3><p>One of the highlights of 2012 has to be the number of public speaking engagements I had throughout the year. Most of my talks centered on my favorite topic, Continuous Delivery. I was able to speak at not only user groups, but a couple of conferences as well. Here's a quick run-down of the public speaking engagements I had in 2012:</p><ul><li>February 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mcjugmd/" rel="nofollow">Montgomery County Java User's Group</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmcgarr/continuous-delivery-tools-and-techniques" rel="nofollow">Continuous Delivery: Tools and Techniques</a></li><li>September 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="http://aplndc.com/" rel="nofollow">DC Agile Leadership Network</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://alndcseptember2012-eorg.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">Continuous Delivery Applied</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmcgarr/continuous-delivery-applied" rel="nofollow">(slides)</a></li><li>September 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/" rel="nofollow">DC Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment Meetup</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/events/80979862/" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Continuous Delivery</a><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmcgarr/continuous-delivery-applied-dc-ci-user-group" rel="nofollow">(slides)</a></li><li>October 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="http://agiledc.org/" rel="nofollow">Agile DC</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmcgarr/continuous-delivery-applied-agiledc" rel="nofollow">Continuous Delivery Applied</a></li><li>November 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="http://agilerichmond.com/" rel="nofollow">Agile Richmond</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmcgarr/continuous-delivery-applied-agile-richmond" rel="nofollow">Continuous Delivery Applied</a></li><li>December 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="http://dc-agile-engineering-conference.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">DC Agile Engineering Conference</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/excellaco/improving-design-through-test-driven-development-tdd" rel="nofollow">Improving Design through Test Driven Development</a></li><li>December 2012 -&nbsp;<a href="http://dc-agile-engineering-conference.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">DC Agile Engineering Conference</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/excellaco/continuous-delivery-applied-15574679" rel="nofollow">Continuous Delivery Applied</a></li></ul><p>It is hard to pick my favorite speaking engagement. It was an honor to speak at Agile DC and a lot of fun being a part of the first DC Agile Engineering Conference. It was also awesome to go to Richmond to speak. I love the crowd at MCJUG as well.</p><h3>The DC Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment Meetup<img align="right" alt="cd_book_web1" src="/img/cd_book_web1.jpg" width="148" height="200" /></h3><p>In 2012, I started the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/" rel="nofollow">DC Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment Meetup</a>. This has been an awesome experience and a lot of fun to get not only my friends to speak, but also some industry big wigs. The group meets once a month to discuss real-life war stories. While we have only had four meetings, it has been an awesome experience that I hope to build on in 2013. Please join the group and come out and have fun. I am hoping to have future meetings at BB HQ.</p><p>The highlights of this group was having&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDuvall" rel="nofollow">Paul Duvall</a>, the primary author of THE&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Integration-Improving-Software-Reducing/dp/0321336380" rel="nofollow">Continuous Integration</a>&nbsp;book, came to speak about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/events/81129322/" rel="nofollow">Continuous Delivery in the Cloud</a>. Depsite the A/V outage in the middle of his talk, he did a great job and it was a great experience.</p><p>Our first meeting of 2013 is tomorrow night, where Sanjeev Sharma from IBM will talk about&nbsp;<a href="http://dc-agile-engineering-conference.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow">DevOps for Mobile applications</a>.</p><h3>Early and Often</h3><p>While I do enjoy blogging, I was only able to compose 20 blog posts in 2012. That's a pretty low number all things considered. My blog did get some decent traffic, with a total of 25K views over the year. Unfortunately, my most popular posts were not from this year, but from previous years. I hope to double the number of posts in 2013.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1335 aligncenter" alt="steve-feldman" src="/img/steve-feldman.png" width="300" height="184" /><br /><sub>All pictures of Stephen Feldman from Google Image Search.</sub></p><h3>Meeting Steve</h3><p>Sometime in the middle of summer, my friend <a title="Andy Glover" href="http://thediscoblog.com/" target="_blank">Andy Glover</a> sent me an email asking if I was interested in a DevOps gig at <a title="Blackboard, Inc." href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a>. The email was from <a title="Steve Feldman" href="https://twitter.com/PerfForensics" target="_blank">Steve Feldman</a> who was looking for a team lead. &nbsp;At the time, I was already contemplating my next move and agreed to meet Steve for coffee. I was working at a client in DC and decided to walk to BB for coffee. It was a pretty long walk, but it was worth it. Steve shows up in a golf shirt, short and sandals. That was the first good sign. The second good sign was that Steve had brought with him a printout of&nbsp;<a href="/blog/alm.html" rel="nofollow">a blog entry I had written from 2011</a>. Steve and I hit it off and he explained what he was looking for. This sounded great. The third good sign was when Steve invited me to play golf. I love golf. It was a great course and a great day.</p><p>Over the course of the months, Steve and I continued to discuss the opportunity. Eventually I met with other members of Blackboard and an offer was made. I promptly turned in my resignation at Excella Consulting and joined Blackboard as the Director of Learn DevOps.</p><h3>Getting started at Blackboard</h3><p>November saw my first day at Blackboard. I was excited to have an office and a great team to work with. I knew that I would be spending the first month or so learning as much as I could about the DevOps team and how Blackboard develops Learn. I spent most of November in&nbsp;one on onemeetings. Besides HR tasks, little else was accomplished.</p><p>In December, I started working on my assessment of the Learn Product Development organization. It was exciting working with members of the various departments and learning all I could about how the "cheese was made". &nbsp;The process took longer than I expected but I put together a presentation for management and it went well. &nbsp;Now, I have just have to execute on my plan. &nbsp;The fun begins!</p>
