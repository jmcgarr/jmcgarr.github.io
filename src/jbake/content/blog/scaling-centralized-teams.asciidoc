goal:

* how nflx engtools team scales to support engineering innovation

takeaways

* a centralized team is not a devops team
* not all customers are equal...so one size does not fit all
* focus on customer service, by enabling self-service
* scaling to serve customers, by building products


topics to cover:

* we are not devops, the culture is devops
* productizing innovations
** who owns innovation
* tools to services (the spectrum)
* customer service model
* enabling self-service
* consulting and coaching
* change as a service
* use third party products when it makes sense...but building it yourself is a fine option too.
