<p>After almost two months of digital silence, I am inching my way back online.  I took a brief hiatus to get married and go an awesome honeymoon, and I think that I am now just getting back to my blog, twitter feed and general nerding.  It is also golf season and I couldn't be more excited to get out there and play.</p>
<p>So, regarding technology, I have working on a lot of fun stuff and in general just refining my craft.  I expect to be updating my blog with a lot of good stuff, and maybe even some questions, so stay tuned...cause I am not going anywhere!</p>
