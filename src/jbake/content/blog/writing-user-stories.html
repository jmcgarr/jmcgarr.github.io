title=Writing User Storiesdate=2012-05-04type=posttags=agile, INVEST, requirements, testing, user storiesstatus=published~~~~~~<p>A friend recently asked me if I had any advise on how to write <a title="User Story (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story" target="_blank">user stories</a>.  While I don't claim to be an expert on writing user stories, I knew enough to guide him.  Here's what I came up with.</p><h3>Why User Stories?</h3><p>User stories are a terse requirements format that puts emphasis on conversations rather than comprehensive documentation.  User stories are the preferred requirements format for <a title="Manifesto of Agile Software Development" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile</a> software development projects.  Other requirements formats, like <a title="Use Cases" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case" target="_blank">use cases</a>, attempt to provide a definitive requirements definition.  Unfortunately, due to their verbose nature, they do not allow for changes to the requirements that are discovered over time.  User stories excel at this.</p><h3>The 3 C's</h3><p><a title="Ron Jeffries" href="http://xprogramming.com/index.php" target="_blank">Ron Jeffries</a> defines <a title="Ron Jeffries 3 C's of User Stories" href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/expcardconversationconfirmation/" target="_blank">3 C's</a> which are the critical aspects of a user story:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Card</strong></em> - user stories should be written on a card.  This helps keep them small.  The card serves a placeholder for the conversation.  The card is what is used during <a title="Release Planning" href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/planninggame.html" target="_blank">release planning</a>.</li><li><em><strong>Conversation</strong></em> - as previously stated, a user story puts emphasis on having a conversation between the customer and the programmers.  Ron points out that these conversations can be supplemented by documents, and the best documents at examples.</li><li><em><strong>Confirmation</strong></em> - this refers to the acceptance criteria or test for each user story.  The customer should communicate the acceptance tests prior to development.  The best type of confirmation for a user story is an example, and preferably automated.</li></ul><h3>User Story Format</h3><p>User stories traditionally conform to the following format:</p><blockquote><p>As a &lt;type of user&gt;,<br />I want &lt;some feature&gt;,<br />So that &lt;some reason or business value&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Most agile experts would agree that the most important part of a user story is the last line, which defines the business value.  Since this the most important line, I tend to prefer <a title="Elizabeth Keogh" href="http://lizkeogh.com/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Keogh</a>'s <a title="Elizabeth Koening's User Story Format" href="http://sirenian.livejournal.com/47679.html" target="_blank">user story format</a>, that looks like this:</p><blockquote><p>In order to &lt;some reason or business value&gt;<br />As a &lt;type of user&gt;,<br />I want &lt;some feature&gt;</p></blockquote><p>This format places the business value statement first.  When writing a ne story, you are forced to think about the business value before the feature.</p><h3>INVEST</h3><p>The <a title="INVEST in good stories" href="http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/" target="_blank">INVEST</a> model is a way of evaluating the quality of a user story.  Here's what it stands for:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Independent</strong></em> - a user story should not be dependent upon another story.</li><li><em><strong>Negotiable</strong></em> - the details of the story will be worked out during the conversation.  Talk about the story before working on it.</li><li><em><strong>Valuable</strong></em> - the user story needs to be valuable to the customer or user.</li><li><em><strong>Estimable</strong></em> - the estimation need not be perfect, but good enough so you can rank and schedule a story.</li><li><em><strong>Small</strong></em> - small is good.  Small is easier to estimate.</li><li><em><strong>Testable</strong></em> - make sure that you can validate the user story is done.  Write tests!</li></ul><h3>Further Reading</h3><p>For more information on user stories, I highly recommend these resources.  I especially recommend <a title="Fadi Stephan" href="https://twitter.com/#!/FadiStephan" target="_blank">Fadi Stephan</a>'s (a fellow <a title="Excella Consutling" href="http://excella.com/" target="_blank">Excellain</a>) great presentation, <a title="The Art of Storytelling" href="http://www.agilejourneyman.com/2010/10/art-of-storytelling.html" target="_blank">the Art of Storytelling</a>.</p><ul><li><a title="User Stories" href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/topics/user-stories">Michael Cohn on User Stories</a></li><li><a title="Wikipedia on User Stories" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story" target="_blank">Wikipedia on User Stories</a></li><li><a title="User Stories at ExtremeProgramming.com" href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html" target="_blank">Extreme Programming on User Stories</a></li><li><a title="Ron Jeffries on the 3C's" href="http://xprogramming.com/articles/expcardconversationconfirmation/" target="_blank">Ron Jeffries on the 3 C's</a></li><li><a title="Elizabeth Keogh on User Story Format" href="http://sirenian.livejournal.com/47679.html" target="_blank">Elizabeth Keogh on User Story Format</a></li><li><a title="Dan North on User Stories" href="http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/" target="_blank">Dan North on User Stories</a></li></ul>
