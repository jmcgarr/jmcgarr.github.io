<p>I have heard this a number of times recently from friends and colleagues.  They come to me asking if I know of anybody or if I have any recommendations on how to hire a DevOps expert.</p><h1>What problem are you trying to solve?</h1><p>My first question to them is, what are you really trying to solve with this expert?</p><blockquote><p>"We have a quality issues" "We need to make production operations a first class requirement" "We want to focus on continuous integration" "We need to automate more tests"</p></blockquote><p>Each of these are important, but none of these says DevOps.  Yes, they are</p><h1>Do you really need a DevOps expert?</h1><p>Anybody informed on what DevOps is knows that DevOps is a philosophy, a way of thinking, but most of all, it's part of your culture. Can hiring a single person change your culture?  Well, yes and no.  If you are a two person team, then adding a third person to the team will definitely change your culture, whether you like it or not.</p>
