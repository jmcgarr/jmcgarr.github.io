<p>Yesterday I posted a video of <a title="Sam Brown" href="https://twitter.com/SamuelBrownIV" target="_blank">Sam Brown</a> and I giving a talk on <a title="Improving Design through TDD" href="http://earlyandoften.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/improving-designs-through-tdd/" target="_blank">Improving Design through TDD</a>.  We gave this talk at the DC Agile Engineering Conference last December.  I was also lucky enough to give a second that day on Continuous Delivery Applied.  Like the previous talk, this one was also recorded and I am sharing it here.</p>
