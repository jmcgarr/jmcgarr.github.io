title=Octopress on OS Xdate=2012-05-05type=posttags=bundler, octopress, rake, ruby, rvmstatus=published~~~~~~<p>I have been wanting to try <a title="Octopress" href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress</a> for a while, so I decided to spent my Friday night setting it up.  Unfortunately, I ran into a few issues installing and getting my environment setup, and I figured I would share my setup issues with everybody else.  I started with the instructions from the Octopress website.</p><p><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/" target="_blank">http://octopress.org/docs/setup/</a></p><p>As you run into issues, the solutions are listed below.</p><h3>RVM and Ruby Installation</h3><p>First, you will need to install <a title="RVM" href="https://rvm.io/" target="_blank">RVM</a>.  I followed the instructions I found on the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2010/9/23/install-rails-ruby-mac" target="_blank">Pragmatic Press article</a> for installing <a title="Ruby" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> 1.9.  You can continue on with the <a title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a> portion of the installation, but you don't need to for Octopress.  The only thing I would change is the version mentioned in the instructions from 1.9.3 to 1.9.2-p320, which is the version needed for Octopress.</p><h3>Bundler</h3><p>Once you get Ruby installed, you will also hit issues with installing bundler with <a href="https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent" target="_blank">rb-fsevent</a>.  I found this <a href="https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/26" target="_blank">bug report</a> that provides the <a href="https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/26#issuecomment-4050279" target="_blank">solution</a> (mad props <a href="https://github.com/clippit" target="_blank">clippit</a>).  In short, you will need to run the following command before setting up Octopress:</p><pre>sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/</pre><h3>Rake</h3><p>When I ran the 'rake install' command, I got the following error:</p><pre>$ rake install rake aborted! You have already activated rake 0.9.2.2, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.9.2. Using bundle exec may solve this.[/sourcecode" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></pre><p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/250" target="_blank">bug report</a> for this on Octopress, but it was easy enough to fix by just updating the Gemfile.lock to point to rake 0.9.2.2 instead of 0.9.2.  I imagine there is a better way to do this with Ruby, but since this is my first foray into Ruby development.</p><p>That should resolve your issues.  Best of luck!</p>
