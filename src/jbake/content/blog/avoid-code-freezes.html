<p>A project manager recently told me that he wanted to implement a code freeze prior to user acceptance testing.  This request struck me as odd since I don’t recall having implemented a code freeze on a project in years.  My immediate response was that we do not need a code freeze.  All checked in code is tested for its production readiness via a deployment pipeline.</p><p>The intent of a code freeze is to identify and lock down a known "good" state of the source code.  The code can then be built, and then deployed from this known "good" state.  If a developer checks in a change after a code freeze, then this known "good" state can be considered tainted.   The intent behind implementing a code freeze is well placed, but the execution slows down a team’s progress.</p><p>The need to implement a code freeze demonstrates a lack of understanding of version control systems (VCS).  Most VCS allow you to tag a particular known state of source code.  By tagging a known “good” state of the source code, developers can continue checking in changes.  The tagged known “good” state can now be built and deployed, without slowing down developers.</p><p>Deployment pipelines make this process much simpler to administer.  As changes are checked into version control, the continuous integration server checks out the new revision and executes a build.  If the change passes all tests in the pipeline, then the revision is tagged.  Ideally, this tag maps back to the build number using a naming convention.  This provides traceability.</p><p>So if you find yourself in a situation where you want to implement a code freeze, think twice before you do.  It is likely that you can get around this by better utilizing your VCS.</p>
