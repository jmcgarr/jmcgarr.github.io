In order to create a DevOps culture you will need to do all these things.  == Do you really need a DevOps expert?Anybody informed on what DevOps is knows that DevOps is a philosophy, a way of thinking, but most of all, it's part of your culture. Can hiring a single person change your culture?  Well, yes and no.  If you are a two person team, then adding a third person to the team will definitely change your culture, whether you like it or not.
