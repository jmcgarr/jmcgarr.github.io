summary=It wasn’t an easy decision, voluntarily choosing to leave Netflix after 4 and a half years. It was a decision I mulled over for months. I mulled over this decision because Netflix is the MOST AMAZING place I’ve ever worked. I know that I will compare all future employers to the Netflix culture and the experiences I've had here. I am forever grateful for being able to experience Netflix for as long as I did. For this, I give thanks.

It wasn’t an easy decision, voluntarily choosing to leave Netflix after 4 and a half years. It was a decision I mulled over for months. I mulled over this decision because Netflix is the MOST AMAZING place I’ve ever worked. I know that I will compare all future employers to the Netflix culture and the experiences I've had here. I am forever grateful for being able to experience Netflix for as long as I did. For this, I give thanks.

_Thank you Netflix, for pushing me to be a *better partner* to my peers and while fostering a culture of *collaboration over competition*._

_Thank you Netflix, for the gift of *feedback*, which has pushed me to be a better colleague, manager and human being._

It is, with this, that I say goodbye to Netflix. I love you and I will miss you, but it is time for me to move on. Even though you are far from perfect, but I know you will only get better. I will watch from afar and cheer you on.
