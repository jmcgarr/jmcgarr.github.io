(thanks to <a title="MattMakai.com" href="http://www.mattmakai.com/" target="_blank">Matt Makai</a> for pointing this tool out)  You build your presentations in html (div = slide) and using tags and css, you can manipulate size, position, scale and even animation within your slide.  It is also the newest tool on the scene and seems promising.  By building my presentation in impress.js, I will be forced to beef up my front-end skills, which have been lacking as of late.</p><p>I also discovered that impress.js presentations can easily be hosted on <a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> using <a title="GitHub Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.  Since my presentation is just a web page, all I have to do is push my changes to the <em>gh-pages</em> branch of my GitHub repository and wait for the site to be displayed.  GitHub will deploy the website using a url following this convention:</p><blockquote><p>http://${username}.github.com/${repositoryname}</p></blockquote><p>Github Pages works for private repositories as well, and all you need to do to enable it is create the <em>gh-pages</em> branch.  Having my presentation displayed directly from version control with a simple url makes the process simple to manage.  Updates to the latest version are a git add, commit, push away.</p><p>Since I am just starting down this road, I may have some further feedback on how these tools work out, but so far, the presentation is looking great!  If interested in any or all of these presentation technologies, here are some sample presentations:</p><ul><li><a title="TDD your CLI presentation" href="http://tdd-ruby-cli.heroku.com/#1" target="_blank">TDD your CLI</a> by <a title="Dave Copeland's website" href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/" target="_blank">Dave Copeland</a> (showoff)</li><li><a title="HTML5 Slides" href="http://slides.html5rocks.com/#landing-slide" target="_blank">HTML5 Demo Slides</a> at <a title="HTML5 Rocks " href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/" target="_blank">HTML5Rocks</a> (HTML5 slides)</li><li><a title="Coca Cola Company Presentation" href="http://prezi.com/ftv9hvziwqi2/coca-cola-company/" target="_blank">Coca Cola Company</a> (Prezi.com)</li><li><a title="12412.org Presentation" href="http://extra.12412.org/digibury/#/title" target="_blank">12412.org Presentation</a> (impress.js)</li></ul>
