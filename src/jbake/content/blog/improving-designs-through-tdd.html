<p>Last December, I was invited to speak at the first annual <a title="DC Agile Engineering Conference" href="http://dc-agile-engineering-conference.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">DC Agile Engineering Conference</a>.  For this conference, I collaborated with a former colleague of mine, <a title="Sam Brown IV" href="https://twitter.com/SamuelBrownIV" target="_blank">Sam Brown</a> on one of my talks.  Sam and I are both proponents of Test Driven Development and practiced it together on projects, so it made sense for us to talk about TDD.</p>
<p>The focus of our talk was on how Test Driven Development improves the design of an application.  We were lucky enough that our talk was recorded, and I would like to share this talk here with you today.</p>
