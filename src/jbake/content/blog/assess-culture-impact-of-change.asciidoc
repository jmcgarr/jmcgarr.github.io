When embarking on a DevOps transformation, you should anticipate resistance. Making the jump to DevOps means changing portions of how your organization functions. This will likely mean that you will in turn be changing portions of your company's culture as well. And the culture will resist. Any change to a culture, even if the change is a positive and obvious step forward, will be met with resistance. Knowing how much resistance your change campaign is likely to encounter can help you plan ahead, possibly ensuring the success of the change.

In my experience, the *deeper* into a culture a change is, the more resistance you are likely to encounter. Using the link:/blog/understanding-culture.html[cultural model I introduced in my previous post], we can gauge the *depth* of a proposed change within an organization's culture. The lower on the cultural pyramid a change goes, the greater the resistance will be.

For example, if you were to propose a switch from http://www.bitbucket.com[Bitbucket] to http://github.com[Github], you should anticipate minimal resistance. Why? Because switching from Bitbucket to Github does not force engineers to change their behavior or their values. Yes there are differences between the two product. But you are still using Git, you can still do pull requests, you can still fork repositories, etc. They are essentially two flavors of the same tool. Switching between these two tools does not change any *processes* or *behavior* for versioning code.

Proposing a tooling change could have significant cultural impacts. We (Engineering Tools) are frequently upgrading, improving and swapping tools we support. In 2014 we switched from Perforce to Git and recognized (sometimes too late) that this change required engineers to alter how they thought about code integration. For engineers that had never used Github for open source development, the learning curve was steep. This slowed teams down and put a significant burden on us to educate, train and provide guidance on how to effectively use Git. This switch impacted not only the core version control system but also impacted any custom scripts engineers had written. Engineers needed to stop thinking about long lived dev/test/prod branches and start thinking in of short lived feature branches. They had to learn about how distributed version control differed from centralized version control. They had to learn to use pull requests for code reviews and integrating changes rather than leaning on Crucible. This change to our version control system impacted not only the *tool* engineers at Netflix used, but the *processes* they used for integration and the *behaviors* for saving code changes.

When planning a change within your organization, you can gauge the resistance by asking your self simple questions. The more questions you answer yes to, the bigger the change is to the culture, and the more resistance you will encounter.

* Will this change require we switch the *tools* we use?
* Will this change require some of our *processes* to change?
* Will this change require people to change any of their *behavior*?
* Will this change require our organization to change our *values*?
* Will this change require that we let go of some of the *people* from our organization?

Resistance doesn't take the form of people saying no to your change. You can sometime think of resistance as friction to successfully rolling out a change. A good example of friction is training needed to successfully roll out a change. Knowing what form of resistance your change will receive depends heavily on the culture and the nature of the change. While knowing the answers to the questions above will help you gauge resistance, the nature of the resistance may be unknown.
