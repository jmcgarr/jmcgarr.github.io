<p>I recently had an interesting conversation with a developer about unit testing, object-oriented design and in general, how to write good code.  Our discussion went around in circles, and I found myself where I usually end up in conversations like this, quoting experts like <a title="Martin Fowler's website" href="http://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a>, <a title="Uncle Bob on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/unclebobmartin" target="_blank">Uncle Bob</a>, and numerous others.  Having had the conversation numerous times before, I decided it was about time I compile a list of my favorite books that all developer's should read.  This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of the greatest books ever, but merely books that I have found invaluable to contributing to better code and projects.</p><ul><li><a title="The Pragmatic Programmer, the book" href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer" target="_blank">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> (Andy Hunt and David Thomas) - This is probably the bible of the modern software engineer.  Provides practical advise about how to write software smartly.</li><li><a title="Amazon.com book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627" target="_blank">Growing Object-Oriented Code, Guided by Tests</a> (Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce) - Exceptional book on how to execute Test Driven Development, with a special emphasis on mocking.  I especially like their approach of starting with end-to-end tests and working your way through the design.</li><li><a title="Continuous Delivery the book." href="http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a> (Jez Humble and David Farley) - When I read this book, I was furious at all the time I wasted on previous projects doing it wrong.  This book changed my view of how to run a software project.</li><li><a title="Clean Code, the book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a> (Robert C. Martin) - This book contains an amazing collection of advise and guidance on how to write code.</li><li><a title="Working Effectively with Legacy Code, the book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052" target="_blank">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> (Michael Feathers) - This book is by no means just about Legacy Code, but it is also about refactoring, design and most importantly testing.  Even though some of the examples are in C++, I still found this book absolutely essential in the consulting industry.</li><li><a title="The Productive Programmer, the book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Productive-Programmer-Theory-Practice-OReilly/dp/0596519788" target="_blank">The Productive Programmer</a> (Neal Ford) - In my o pinion, an underrated book.  This book focuses on how to make yourself more productive as a programmer by automating tasks in your development environment.</li><li><a title="Release It!, the book" href="http://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it" target="_blank">Release It! Design and Deploy Production Ready Software</a> (Michael Nygard) - Great book about how to design scalable and stable systems that can with stand the test of production.</li><li><a title="Specification by Example, the book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Specification-Example-Successful-Deliver-Software/dp/1617290084" target="_blank">Specification by Example: How Successful Teams Deliver the Right Software</a> (Gojko Adzic) - My most recent addition to my favorite books list and the least technical of the bunch.  This book focuses on how your team identifies, evaluates and refine requirements into executable specifications.</li></ul><p>I would love to hear what other developers think should be on this list.  Enjoy!</p>
