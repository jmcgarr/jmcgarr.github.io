<p><img align="right" alt="Blackboard_Logo_235x227" src="/img/blackboard_logo_235x227.gif" height="227" width="235" />November 5th was my first day at <a title="Blackboard" href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard, Inc.</a> as the Director for <a title="Learn" href="http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Learn/Overview.aspx" target="_blank">Learn</a> DevOps, and I couldn't be more excited.  I joined a smart and energetic team that is interested in delivering high quality software to their customers.  My role will allow me to apply my knowledge and interests in continuous integration, test automation, deployment automation and more to a mature software product development team.  I look forward to posting more on this blog about my new experiences at Blackboard.</p>
