<p>It has been far too long since <a href="http://earlyandoften.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/improving-my-shell-fu-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank">I last blogged</a>.  There have been a number of reasons, most notably work, family and golf (yeah golf!).  But too much has happened since I last blogged…so I need to get back into it.</p><p>Before I go into all the fun things I have been doing, I figured I would do a quick status check on <a title="Goals for 2013" href="http://earlyandoften.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/goals-for-2013/" target="_blank">the goals I set at the beginning of the year</a>.  Let's go through them one by one:</p><ul><li><strong>Reading List</strong> - Like everything else, I have slowed a down my reading a bit.  Here's what I have read so far.<ul><li><a title="A Game of Thrones: A Feast for Crows" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/055358202X" target="_blank">Game of Thrones: A Feast for Crows</a></li><li><a title="Game of Thrones: A Dance of Dragons (Amazon)" href="http://www.amazon.com/Dance-Dragons-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553582011/ref=pd_sim_b_3" target="_blank">Game of Thrones: A Dance of Dragons</a></li><li><a title="The Phoenix Project" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592" target="_blank">The Phoenix Project</a></li><li><a title="Kanban book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kanban-Successful-Evolutionary-Technology-Business/dp/0984521402" target="_blank">Kanban</a></li><li><a title="Putting out of Your Mind" href="http://www.amazon.com/Putting-Out-Your-Mind-Rotella/dp/0743212134" target="_blank">Putting out of your Mind</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Blackboard</strong> - Am I killing it?  I guess I didn't really set a <a title="SMART Criteria " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank">SMART</a> goal here.  Definitely have a long way to go for me to declare success, but I am having a blast!</li><li><strong>Blogging</strong> - This is a big blemish.  I was supposed to write 1 blog entry a week for the year.  So far, this entry marks 11th entry.  I am 14 weeks behind schedule.  Challenge accepted!</li><li><strong>DC Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment Meetup</strong> - <a title="The DC CI Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration" target="_blank">This group</a> has far exceeded my expectations.  Here are the metrics:<ul><li>Targeted 250 members, <a title="DC CI Membership" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/members/" target="_blank">currently at 360+</a>.  Awesome!</li><li>We have met once a month so far</li><li>No workshops scheduled</li></ul></li><li><strong>Public Speaking</strong> - I will talk about this more in future blogs, but so far.  Here's where I stand:<ul><li>Public Speaking Events - I have given three talks this year, two of them were repeats. This is complete.</li><li>New Talks Given - None given, but one scheduled.  More on that later.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chef</strong> - I have made some progress but not as much as I would like.  I am hoping the addition of a new team member will help create some progress in this area.</li><li><strong>Jenkins Plugins</strong> - Technically speaking, I was able to do this.  I had <a title="Accepted Pull Request" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/pull/30" target="_blank">a pull request accepted</a> for the <a title="Jenkins Job DSL plugin" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin" target="_blank">Jenkins Job DSL plugin</a>.  We recently had an <a title="Twitter Feed of Innovation Day" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bbinnovate13&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">Innovation Day</a> (hack event) at Blackboard and <a title="Michael Dumont" href="https://twitter.com/thedumontster" target="_blank">Michael Dumont</a> and I were able to add a simple feature to the <a title="Etsy Master Project Plugin" href="https://github.com/etsy/jenkins-master-project" target="_blank">Etsy Master Project Jenkins Plugin</a>.  Pull request pending.</li><li><strong>Ruby</strong> - No progress to date, other than Chef work.  Hopefully I can find a window to focus on this.</li></ul><p>All in all, I do feel like this year is right on track, with the exception of this blog.  I have promised myself to focus more on blogging, so expect good things.</p>
