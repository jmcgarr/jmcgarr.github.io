I am the Engineering Manager for the http://www.netflix.com/[Netflix] Developer Productivity team. I have been developing Java/JVM-based applications for most of my career and been known to dabble in other languages as well. I am  passionate about building quality software through automation. You can frequently find me talking about link:/tags/agile.html[Agile], link:/tags/continuous-delivery.html[Continuous Delivery], link:/tags/devops.html[DevOps], or build and test automation.

In 2015, I took on an extended larger team responsible for all tooling from source to immutable artifacts. This larger team focuses on Developer Productivity. Prior to that, I managed the Netflix Build Tools team (now part of Developer Productivity). I joined Netflix in early 2014.

Prior to Netflix, I was the Director of DevOps, for http://www.blackboard.com/[Blackboard] http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Learn/Overview.aspx[Learn] (their flagship product). As Director of DevOps, I was responsible for the build and test infrastructure, as well as the development tooling.  In addition to managing the DevOps team, I was charged with coaching senior management, engineering and QA on how to migrate Blackboard Learn towards continuous delivery.

I began my career in the Washington, D.C. metro area as a software engineer consulting for the federal government. I started out at http://www.boozallen.com/[Booz Allen Hamilton] where I cut my teeth building software solutions for the http://www.mcrc.marines.mil/[Marine Corps Recruting Command] and the http://www.nsf.gov/[National Science Foundation]. My passion to build automation, continuous integration and test automation was cultivated here.
