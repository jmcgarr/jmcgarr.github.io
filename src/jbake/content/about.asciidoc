I am the Engineering Manager for the http://www.netflix.com/[Netflix] Build Tools team. I have been developing Java/JVM-based applications for most of my career and been known to dabble in other languages as well. I am  passionate about building quality software through automation. You can frequently find me talking about link:/tags/agile.html[Agile], link:/tags/continuous-delivery.html[Continuous Delivery], link:/tags/devops.html[DevOps], or build and test automation.  I am the founder of the http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-delivery[DC Continuous Delivery meetup].

In 2014, I moved my family to the Bay Area to join Netflix's Engineering Tools team, as a Senior Software Engineer. At Netflix, I was responsible for helping engineering teams adopt the tools available, and make the migration process as simple as possible.  In mid-2014, I accepted the role of Engineering Manager for the Build Tools team.

In 2012, I moved out of consulting and joined http://www.blackboard.com/[Blackboard, Inc.] as the Director of DevOps, for http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Learn/Overview.aspx[Learn] (their flagship product).  As Director of DevOps, I was responsible for the build and test infrastructure, as well as the development tooling.  In addition worked to migrate Blackboard Engineering towards Continuous Delivery, by coaching senior management, engineering and QA.

I began my career in the Washington, D.C. metro area as a software engineer consulting for the federal government. I started out at http://www.boozallen.com/[Booz Allen Hamilton] where I cut my teeth building software solutions for the http://www.mcrc.marines.mil/[Marine Corps Recruting Command] and the http://www.nsf.gov/[National Science Foundation]. My passion to build automation, continuous integration and test automation was cultivated here. In 2009 I joined http://www.excella.com/[Excella Consulting], where I was immersed in the world of Agile software development. At Excella, I began to My Continuous Delivery journey, automating deployment pipelines for customers.
